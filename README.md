# Uber_project
This is an Uber project which I have created with the help of the base SAS and advanced SAS.

In this project I have extract the data from the source and then upload this data into the sas 
environment then I have performed the sanity check, clean the data, validate the data by using 
the different methods and procedures. After cleaning the data we will manipulate our data
and create different datasets using the different functions and methods we will create the 
different variable in those datasets as per our requirement and finally we will combine all 
those datasets in one dataset and export that dataset perform the visualizations on using the 
BI tool such as power BI
